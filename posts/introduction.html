    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>Welcome! My name is ZephyrSeb, and I'd like to welcome you to my <i>Magic: the Gathering</i> design blog. About three years ago, I started making MTG card designs based on my <i>Dungeon & Dragons</i> campaign, known as The Many Worlds. My players were keen <i>Magic</i> players themselves, and what started as a few one-off designs turned into a hobby. As it happens, the theme of the campaign, where the party were world hopping between worlds of widely different genres, was a perfect fit for a game like <i>Magic</i>.</i></p>

    <p>In this blog, I'd like to share a number of lessons I've learned about card game design, along with discussions about what mechanics could do in future <i>Magic</i> sets. I'll even show off some of the custom cards I've made as we go. You can also check out a database of cards I've made.</p>

    <p>I hope you enjoy reading the blog, and theorizing about <i>Magic</i> design with me.</p>
